<h1>Miss Rukudzo's Movie List</h1>
<h2>My list of my 3 fav movies of all-time</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>Charlies Angels</h3>
<p>There is beautiful cinematography, my favourite actresses and lots of action.</p>

<h3>Coraline</h3>
<p>Very creepy, unsettling and the stop motion is beyond its time.</p>

<h3>Everything, everywhere all at once</h3>
<p>Truly captures the feeling of being lost in life. I've cried nearly everytime I've watched it.</p>
